leveldb-server4j
================

Client/server wrapper for LevelDB for Java, written in Scala. Implemented using RPCs generated by Thrift.

LevelDB (pure library without native client/server support): https://github.com/google/leveldb 
Thrift: https://thrift.apache.org

## Todo
- finish readme
- add javadoc to public classes

## Caveats and future releases
As of the current release, the following LevelDB features are still unimplemented: 

- ReadOptions
- WriteOptions
- Snapshot

I also plan to add batching for WriteBatches and Iterators.
