java socket server intro:

use protobuf for encoding requests?

we'll want to have some basic buffering. we should only flush to the server when the batch size is reached or when flush() is called.
until then, the client should just hang onto puts locally.
    - one issue there is WriteOptions. ideally we'd only want to send one WriteOptions per batch. or maybe we could even track
    WriteOptons objects on the server the same way we are with iterators (see below). then instead of passing the whole WriteOptions
    over the wire, we could just pass the randomly generated id and/or the hashcode of the WriteOptions object.

with iterator(), we the server should generate an id and pass that back to the client. then any future operations on that iterator
should pass the id, and the server can do a lookup in its ConcurrentHashMap (or whatever) to get the appropriate iterator.
    - just like with puts, we should batch reads. not really possible for gets, but for iterator, when someone calls next,
    it should actually return the next X to the client. although, we need to figure out how reads are supposed to interact
    with concurrent writes. although it seems fine for now to say that if batch size > 1, iterator might not see concurrent writes.

need to keep reading protobuf docs, but i think the easiest thing is to write the size myself, then probably the type
myself (although i could use protobuf, should read more docs on this), and finally the payload bytes using protobuf.

do we need to flush on get? otherwise we could have: db.put(x,y), db.get(x) == null. maybe this can be
 configurable? how does hbase handle this? i guess there the client is also a memstore.
